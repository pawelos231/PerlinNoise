# PerlinNoise
Perlin noise created in c++
A little perlin noise project created with the help on tutorial on youtube, one of my first steps to understanding game dev in C++ and how to deal with such tasks as noise creation.  
I have plans for this project, it will feature in the future all different kinds of noises: simplex fractal, cellular, white noise, simplex, value and more!
